# Purrfect Match  
### CT80A0000 Data-Intensive Systems 2.9.2024-15.12.2024, course project  
This is our prototype of the Purrfect Match service. Purrfect match service is a platform that would bring together all rescue centers from all around Finland. The main idea is providing a seamless experience for finding and supporting rescue centers, offering personalized rescue animal profiles and making simple user account.


## Getting started  
Restore the databases from the purrfectMatchApp/databases folder to the pgAdmin 4 (version 17). Remember to name databases with exactly same and change the ownership of each database to match your pgAdmin 4 information  
In the purrfectMatchApp/db folder, add your own pgAdmin 4 information (username and password) to the each file.   

### How to run in terminal:  
cd purrfectMatchApp
